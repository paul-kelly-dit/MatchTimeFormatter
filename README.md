# Tools

Used java 11 and scala 13.2

# Running

The following command will run com.pp.timeformatting.Bootstrap
```sbt run```

# Testing

```sbt test``` to fun full test suite

# Requirements

Write a converter that can take a String representing match time in one format, and convert it to a
String representing match time in another format.
The input match time is in the format

```[period] minutes:seconds.milliseconds```

The output should be in the format

```
normalTimeMinutes:normalTimeSeconds - period
```

For the output format, minutes should be padded to two digits and milliseconds should be rounded up
or down to the nearest whole second. Periods are represented in short-form on the input format and
long-form on output format i.e.

Short form Long Form
```
PM PRE_MATCH
H1 FIRST_HALF
HT HALF_TIME
H2 SECOND_HALF
FT FULL_TIME
```

When a given period goes into additional time (i.e. > 45:00.000 for first half, > 90.00.000 for the second
half), the added minutes and seconds are represented separately in the format
normalTimeMinutes:normalTimeSeconds +additionalMinutes:additionalSeconds - period
Any input which does not meet the required input format should result in an output of INVALID
Examples
Input Expected Output

```
"[PM] 0:00.000" "00:00 – PRE_MATCH"
"[H1] 0:15.025" "00:15 – FIRST_HALF"
"[H1] 3:07.513" "03:08 – FIRST_HALF"
"[H1] 45:00.001" "45:00 +00:00 – FIRST_HALF"
"[H1] 46:15.752" "45:00 +01:16 – FIRST_HALF"
"[HT] 45:00.000" "45:00 – HALF_TIME"
"[H2] 45:00.500" "45:01 – SECOND_HALF"
"[H2] 90:00.908" "90:00 +00:01 – SECOND_HALF"
"[FT] 90:00.000" "90:00 +00:00 – FULL_TIME"
"90:00" "INVALID"
"[H3] 90:00.000" "INVALID"
"[PM] -10:00.000" "INVALID"
"FOO" "INVALID"
```

Code should be written to production standard. Sol
